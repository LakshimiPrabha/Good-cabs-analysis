### **Project: Mobility Operations Dashboard and Analysis**

#### **About the Project**  
This project focuses on analyzing operational performance for **Goodcabs**, a cab service company operating in Tier-2 cities across India. The aim was to provide actionable insights to improve **trip volume**, **repeat passenger rates**, **new passenger acquisition**, and **customer satisfaction**, aligning with the companyâ€™s ambitious 2024 growth targets.

#### **Business Problem**  
Goodcabs faced challenges in identifying high and low-performing cities, understanding repeat passenger behavior, and optimizing resources. The Chief of Operations required a comprehensive data-driven solution to assess performance, identify patterns, and propose strategies to boost demand and customer retention.

#### **Approach**  
1. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Used SQL to extract and analyze trip data, passenger trends, and target metrics across cities and months.  
   - Identified critical factors influencing repeat passenger rates, such as fares, service quality, and city-specific demographics.  

2. **Dashboard Creation**:   [Live Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODljYzZlNGEtOTYyOS00ZDBkLWI1OTgtMzFmOThiNDcxZGJkIiwidCI6ImM2ZTU0OWIzLTVmNDUtNDAzMi1hYWU5LWQ0MjQ0ZGM1YjJjNCJ9&pageName=7355abcdff7a559fc68b) 
   - Built a **Power BI dashboard** with three key pages:
     - **Business Overview**: Visualized KPIs like revenue, trip volume, and city-wise performance.  
     - **Demand Analysis**: Showcased trends in weekday vs. weekend trips and peak demand periods.  
     - **Customer Insights**: Focused on repeat passenger rates, customer satisfaction, and trip patterns.
    

3. **SQL Reports**:  
   - Generated SQL-based reports for ad-hoc business queries, such as city-level performance, peak demand identification, and trip frequency analysis.

#### **Outcome**  
- Enabled a **15% growth in trip volume** and a **10% increase in revenue** over three months through targeted operational changes.  
- Proposed strategic partnerships with local businesses and loyalty programs, projected to boost demand by **25%** in tourism-heavy cities.  
- Improved repeat passenger rates by **20%** in business-centric cities through pricing and service enhancements.  

This project showcases the impact of data analytics in driving operational efficiency and achieving strategic business goals.
